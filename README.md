# REU Theory & Allais

A repo containing two *Mathematica* notebooks for applying REU theory to the Allais paradox. Each notebook accompanies a commentary by Johanna Thoma and me on Lara Buchak's book, *Risk and Rationality*. These commentaries challenge the claim that REU theory predicts the modal preferences in the Allais paradox.

1. `original.nb` attempts to model the Allais problem within REU theory as described in our paper ["Risk Writ Large"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11098-017-0916-3).

2. `skewed.nb` analyzes the variant of our original model introduced in [Buchak's reply](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11098-017-0907-4), as critiqued in our [followup commentary](#).
